Get a tree view of all your pages directly in the admin menu. Search, edit, view, re-order/sort and add pages – all is just one click away!

== Description ==

The Admin Menu Tree Page View WordPress plugin adds a page tree to all your pages – directly accessible in the admin menu.
This way all your pages will be available within just one click,
no matter where you are in the admin area.

You can also add pages directly in the tree and you can quickly find your pages by using the search box.

#### Top features
* Change the order of your pages with drag-and-drop
* View all your pages – no matter where in the admin you are
* View the page hierarchy/the tree structure of your pages
* Compatible with WPML, so if you in WPML's language menu have selected to view german pages, then only the german pages will vi visible in the admin menu tree too.
* Add pages directly after or inside another post – no need to first create the post and then select the parent of the page
* Adds link to view a page directly from the admin menu – you don't have to first edit the post and from that page click the view link

Works perfect in CMS-like WordPress installations with lots of pages in a tree hierarchy.
